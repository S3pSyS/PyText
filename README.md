# PyText
A cross platform text editor you can use from your terminal (similar to nano). Written in Python3 by S3pSyS/NecroSyS. 
You can create a new file or write to an existing file aswell as execute commands to make it easier to use.

```
Commands:
/help & /h - display help message.
/cls & /clear - clear terminal.
/exit & /close - save and exit.
/run & /cmd - run os command.
```

Windows:
Running install-windows.bat simply makes PyText accessible from the commandline by using a shortcut.
after running this just type 'pt' to run pytext.

Linux:
Currently I haven't developed a bash script for it but you can do it manually by writing python pytext.py in a bash script
and then using alias pt=<name of your bash script>
